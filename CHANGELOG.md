### 1.0.0 - Initial Release & Experimental VR Development
This release marks the initial official release (v1.0.0) of neom_vr as a new, independent and experimental module within the Open Neom ecosystem. This module is introduced to research and develop Virtual Reality (VR) functionalities, specifically focusing on democratizing VR for smartphone users.

Key Highlights of this Release:

New Module Introduction & Experimental Focus:

neom_vr is now a dedicated module for VR-related processes, serving as an R&D sandbox for mobile VR.

Its primary goal is to explore how immersive experiences can be delivered on readily available smartphone devices.

Foundational VR Capabilities:

Includes initial functionalities for 360 video playback (video_360 integration) and panoramic image viewing (panorama integration).

Implements a smartphone VR split view (split_view) to enable stereoscopic viewing for mobile VR headsets (e.g., Google Cardboard).

Provides experimental integration for launching external web-based VR experiences (e.g., WebVR/WebXR) via custom tabs.

Module-Specific Translations:

Introduced VrTranslationConstants to centralize and manage all UI text strings specific to VR functionalities. This ensures improved localization, maintainability, and consistency with Open Neom's global strategy.

Architectural Alignment for Experimentation:

While experimental, the module is structured to adhere to Open Neom's Clean Architecture principles where feasible, ensuring that its development contributes to the overall modularity and integrity of the project.

It leverages neom_core for core services and neom_commons for reusable UI components and utilities.

Future-Oriented Development:

This initial release lays the groundwork for ambitious future expansion into advanced video editing, interactive VR experiences, biofeedback visualization in VR, and spatial audio.

Overall Benefits of this Initial Release:

Pioneering Accessible VR: Directly addresses Open Neom's vision of democratizing VR, making immersive experiences available to a wider audience.

Dedicated R&D Space: Provides a focused environment for continuous research and development in mobile VR technologies.

Enhanced User Engagement: Introduces novel ways for users to interact with content and experience digital well-being.

Stronger Clean Architecture Adherence: Even as an experimental module, its structured introduction reinforces the modular design principles of Open Neom.
